I developed a solution for early diagnosis of COVID-19 using cough and demographic data, which was accepted for publication in <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3412841.3441943">ACM</a> and featured in a detailed blog on <a href="https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/12/covid-cough-ai-detecting-sounds.html">Kdnuggets</a>, Full project details can be found on the <a href="https://coughresearch.github.io/">website </a> 🦠👩‍⚕️
