Hi there, Iâ€™m Aaditya (Ankit), a Senior Research Engineer specializing in NLP, Deep learning, and Machine learning. My research aims to develop machine learning methods in the Healthcare domain.

I currently work at [Saama](https://www.saama.com/), conducting research to accelerate [clinical trials and reduce drug development timelines](https://www.pfizer.com/news/articles/how_a_novel_incubation_sandbox_helped_speed_up_data_analysis_in_pfizer_s_covid_19_vaccine_trial). Before joining Saama, I worked as an NLP and Backend Engineer at [Prescience](https://prescienceds.com/). My research interests involve Representation Learning on Graphs, Federated learning, XAI, Generative language models and their applications in Healthcare data.

I've been honored to contribute meaningful research and datasets that have been adopted by leading companies like [Facebook AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09085) (Galactica), [Google AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09617) (Med-PaLM, Med-PaLM-2), [Microsoft, and OpenAI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13375) (GPT-4) to further responsible advancements in AI.

I have a deep appreciation for open-source work and contribute to projects including Tensorflow, Pytorch Geometric and HuggingFace. In December 2022, I noticed structured output issues in large language models and developed [Promptify](https://github.com/promptslab/Promptify), which received encouraging feedback on GitHub and assisted relief efforts during the [Turkey-Syria earthquake](https://dev.to/erayg/how-an-open-source-disaster-map-helped-thousands-of-earthquake-survivors-afetharitacom-440). During COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, I initiated a project to capture cough and breath sounds via phone to [classify COVID-19 coughs using deep learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02417), with the aim of aiding doctors in rapid pre-screening of patients.

If you are still reading, here is more about me: Apart from my research life, I'm drawn to activities like Boxing, Jiu-Jitsu and Chess. I enjoy spending time in nature, Observation, and Philosophy. I have realized to some extent that everything is connected; there is neither good nor bad; there is neither positive nor negative. I often displace myself away from social noise, take a seat, and try to see, observe, rather than just looking at it. In the process, I naturally learn.

<!-- I was also privileged to serve as a reviewer for journals [Springer Nature 2021](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/AAA-9381-2021), [IEEE Access 2021](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/AAA-9381-2021) and [IEEE Access 2022](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/AAA-9381-2021). -->

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.test

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
